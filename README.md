# MyExperiment
This repository is one record for the experiment of my researchï¼š**An Edge Supervision aided Dual Attention Transformer for MS and PAN Classification**. 
There were problems with the initial structure design and code architecture, and I have been modifying the network structure and adjusting hyperparameters for more than a month now.

Each version containing the network structure changes is placed in a "Test x" folder.
# Explanation
My current dataset is MS and PAN images of Hohhot. In the beginning my network's test set OA was only 20%-30%. I have continuously improved my code from the aspects of data construction, network construction, and details such as normalization. 

The network OA of the last version is about 65%, and I have not calculated the correct rate of other methods. My current task is to raise the project OA to more than 70% (because the current SOTA calculation methods are around 70%), and then use multiple data sets to calculate the accuracy of various categories, AA and Kappa
